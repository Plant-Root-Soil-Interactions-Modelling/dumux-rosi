root systems are centered and adjusted in xy direction to a cricle with a diameter of 5.598 cm
	1) a scaling factor was use to keep the roots within +/- 0.0279cm (the de-warping has caused distortions in xy-dir, so this an be seen as a correction) 
	2) those root nodes that were still outside the circle were shifted to the closest node within the circle 
root systems are compressed to the depth of the cylinder of 18.5cm (max error of a root system was 1.5cm)
