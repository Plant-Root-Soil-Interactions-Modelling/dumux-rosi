# Introduction

_dumux-rosi_ offers simple Python interfaces to solve Richasds equation or general advection diffusion reactions equations in the scope of plant and soil interaction modelling, 
using [DuMu<sup>x</sup>](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux) as nonlinear finite volume solver. 

# Installation

## Using a Pyton script 

The installation scipt is located within the [CPlantBox](https://github.com/Plant-Root-Soil-Interactions-Modelling/CPlantBox) repository and installs CPlantBox, DuMu<sup>x</sup>, and _dumux-rosi_

For CPlantBox with _dumux-rosi_, download and run the Python file "installDumuxRosi_Ubuntu.py" (the file is based on the DuMu<sup>x</sup> installation file).
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
[ ! -d 'cpbenv' ] && python3 -m venv cpbenv &&  source cpbenv/bin/activate ||  source cpbenv/bin/activate
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Plant-Root-Soil-Interactions-Modelling/CPlantBox/master/installDumuxRosi_Ubuntu.py
python3 installDumuxRosi_Ubuntu.py
```

## by hand

* install DuMu<sup>x</sup> using the [Installation Notes](https://dumux.org/docs/doxygen/master/installation.html)
* install [CPlantBox](https://github.com/Plant-Root-Soil-Interactions-Modelling/CPlantBox) into the DuMu<sup>x</sup>  base folder (where dune-common/, dumux/, etc. are located) according the installation instruction (README.md)
* git clone _dumux-rosi_ in the DuMu<sup>x</sup> common base folder and use dune build system to build the repository.
