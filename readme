## build local
### windows
CPlantBox-Dumux is currently not available on windows. 
Some pointers to setup a linux environment on windows are given on the CPlantBox-wiki 
https://github.com/Plant-Root-Soil-Interactions-Modelling/CPlantBox/wiki/Help-for-windows-users

### linux
If you have ubuntu >= 20.04, you can download the python file "installDumuxRosiWithUbuntu2004.py" from the CPlantBox repository
https://github.com/Plant-Root-Soil-Interactions-Modelling/CPlantBox
This file is based on the dumux installation file. 
run:
python3 installDumuxRosiWithUbuntu2004.py

It will create a "DUMUX" folder and install inside the dependencies necessary to run dumux-rosi.
This script might work on other linux OS but has not been tested.
