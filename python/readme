Examples that are using the dumux-rosi Python binding. They are organized their simulation domain (soil, roots, or coupled):

soil/ 			bulk soil only (e.g. water and or solute transport)
roots/ 			root system only (e.g. water or hormone movement within the xylem)
coupled/		root soil interaction models (coupled by a classical sink, or steady rate approach)
rhizo/ 			1d cylindrical models which describe the rhizosphere (water and solute transport)
coupled_rhizo/		root soil interaction models, which use microscopic rhizosphere models (coupling between soil, roots & rhizo) 

Additional folders for common resources:

modules/		the Python modules of dumux-rosi: 
			* Python part of the DuMux bindings for water and solute movement in the soil
			* Auxilliary class for coupling rhizosphere models (rhizo_models.py)
