Examples that are using the dumux-rosi Python binding. They are organized in three sub folders regarding their simulation domain (soil, roots, or coupled):

soil/ 			bulk soil only (e.g. water and or solute transport)
roots/ 			root system only (e.g. water or hormone movement within the xylem)
coupled/		root soil interaction models 

Additional folders for common resources:

modules/			the Python modules of dumux-rosi: auxiliary tools (vtk, rsml, ...), the Python part of the XylemFlux class, and the Python part of the DuMux bindings
grid_generation		scripts for grid generation (TODO) not quite sure what is in there
