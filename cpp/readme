Subfolders:
Scripts to run the models are located in the python/ subfolder, 
DuMux input files in the input/ subfolder, 
and numerical grids in the grids/ subfolder

modelparameter 		CPlantBox parameters in old depricated format. This is still used in the c++ examples from above

python_binding 		for using DuMux as PDE solver, where teh simulation loop is in python pyhton
